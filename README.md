This repository stores some programs that I developed while studying at the Higher School of Economics (HSE):

1. Molecular dynamics simulation, including realisation of a simple thermostat and calculation of the Maxwell distribution.
2. Parallel integration of the function _x*e^x_ using the _MPI_ and _POSIX Threads_ libraries.
