This repository stores some programs that I developed while studying at the university:

1. Molecular dynamics simulation, including realisation of a simple thermostat and calculation of the Maxwell distribution.
2. Parallel integration of the function $`x e^x`$ using MPI and POSIX Threads libraries.
