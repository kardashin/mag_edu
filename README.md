This repository stores some programs that I developed while studying at the university:

1. Molecular dynamics simulation, including realisation of a simple thermostat and calculation of the Maxwell distribution.
2. Dynamic parallel integration of the function x*e^x by using MPI and POSIX Threads libraries.
